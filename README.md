## Usage

each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. If you open the DevTools console by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) or by right clicking anywhere on the webpage and selecting inspect and clicking on the console tab, a console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser you will be able to see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I have learned thus far from processing my prework and I recommend reveiwing the HTML topic for to study first because you can't build a house without a frame!
